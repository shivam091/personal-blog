This Privacy Policy describes what information is collected when you use this website, how it is used, and your choices.

## Information Collected

- **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracks visitor behavior (pages visited, browser type, approximate location).
  Google may place cookies and collect anonymized usage data. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

- **reCAPTCHA**: The contact form is protected by Google reCAPTCHA to prevent spam.
  reCAPTCHA works by analyzing your interaction with the page (such as mouse movements and clicks) to determine if you are human.
  Use of reCAPTCHA is subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

- **CounterAPI**: This site uses CounterAPI v2 to record anonymous viewer counts for posts.
  CounterAPI may log basic request information (such as IP address, browser type, or referrer) to provide accurate statistics.
  No personally identifiable information is collected, and the data is used solely for traffic analytics.
  See [CounterAPI’s Privacy Policy](https://counterapi.dev/privacy-policy/).

- **Preferences**: Your theme (light/dark) and other settings are stored locally in your
  browser. This data never leaves your device.

- **Form Drafts**: To improve your experience, unsubmitted contact form data (such as your name, email, or message in progress) may be saved in your browser’s
  local storage. This data is stored **only on your device**, is not transmitted to me, and is cleared when you remove it from your browser.

- **Contact Form (Netlify Forms)**:
  When you submit a message through the contact form, the information you provide (such as your name, email address, and message) is securely transmitted and stored by **Netlify Forms**, a service operated by Netlify, Inc.
  This data is used only to respond to your inquiry and is accessible to me through Netlify’s dashboard.
  Netlify may log metadata such as your IP address, browser, and timestamp for spam prevention and service reliability.
  Data submitted through the form is processed according to [Netlify’s Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).
  I do not share, sell, or reuse this data beyond replying to your message.

- **Embedded / Linked Content – CodePen**: Interactive examples on this site can be used in the inbuilt playground.
  Some examples offer a "View on CodePen" option. Clicking this takes you to CodePen, where their platform may collect usage data
  (such as IP address, browser information, or interaction with the example) under their [Privacy Policy](https://blog.codepen.io/legal/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://blog.codepen.io/legal/terms-of-service).
  No personal information is shared with CodePen unless you choose to interact with their platform.

## How Information Is Used

- To operate and improve the site.
- To communicate with you when you contact me.
- To analyze site traffic.
- To comply with legal obligations.

## Security & Retention

Reasonable measures are taken to protect your information, though no method is 100% secure.
- Google Analytics data is retained by Google under their policies.
- Local preferences and form drafts remain until cleared from your browser.
- CounterAPI statistics are retained by CounterAPI under their own policies.

## Third-Party Services

- **Google Analytics**: Used to measure traffic. You can opt out via [this tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

- **Google reCAPTCHA v3**: Used to protect the contact form against spam and abuse.
  reCAPTCHA analyzes interactions with the page (such as mouse movements, clicks, or device information)
  to determine if a visitor is human. Use of reCAPTCHA is governed by
  [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and
  [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

- **CounterAPI v2**: Used to display post view counts. Collects minimal, anonymous request data to provide statistics.

- **Embedded content**: Some posts may include third-party embeds (e.g., GitHub, YouTube) which collect their own data under their privacy  policies.

- **Netlify Forms**: Used to handle form submissions securely.
  Netlify temporarily processes and stores submitted data (including metadata such as IP address and submission time) to deliver it to me.
  Data handling is governed by [Netlify’s Privacy Policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

- **CodePen**: Clicking "View on CodePen" links takes you to their site, where CodePen may collect usage data as described in their [Privacy Policy](https://blog.codepen.io/legal/privacy-policy).

I do not sell or trade personal information, but third-party platforms may collect usage data when their content is embedded or linked.
