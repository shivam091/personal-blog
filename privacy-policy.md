This Privacy Policy describes what information is collected when you use this website, how it is used, and your choices.

## Information Collected

- **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracks visitor behavior (pages visited, browser type, approximate location).
  Google may place cookies and collect anonymized usage data. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

- **reCAPTCHA**: The contact form is protected by Google reCAPTCHA to prevent spam.
  reCAPTCHA works by analyzing your interaction with the page (such as mouse movements and clicks) to determine if you are human.
  Use of reCAPTCHA is subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

- **CounterAPI**: This site uses CounterAPI v2 to record anonymous viewer counts for posts.
  CounterAPI may log basic request information (such as IP address, browser type, or referrer) to provide accurate statistics.
  No personally identifiable information is collected, and the data is used solely for traffic analytics.
  See [CounterAPI’s Privacy Policy](https://counterapi.dev/privacy-policy/).

- **Preferences**: Your theme (light/dark) and other settings are stored locally in your
  browser. This data never leaves your device.

- **Form Drafts**: To improve your experience, unsubmitted contact form data (such as your name, email, or message in progress) may be saved in your browser’s
  local storage. This data is stored **only on your device**, is not transmitted to me, and is cleared when you remove it from your browser.

- **Contact Form**: If you submit the contact form, your name, email, and message are used solely to respond to your
  inquiry. This data is not sold or shared with third parties.

## How Information Is Used

- To operate and improve the site.
- To communicate with you when you contact me.
- To analyze site traffic.
- To comply with legal obligations.

## Security & Retention

Reasonable measures are taken to protect your information, though no method is 100% secure.
- Google Analytics data is retained by Google under their policies.
- Local preferences and form drafts remain until cleared from your browser.
- CounterAPI statistics are retained by CounterAPI under their own policies.

## Third-Party Services

- **Google Analytics**: Used to measure traffic. You can opt out via [this tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
- **Google reCAPTCHA v3**: Used to protect the contact form against spam and abuse.
  reCAPTCHA analyzes interactions with the page (such as mouse movements, clicks, or device information)
  to determine if a visitor is human. Use of reCAPTCHA is governed by
  [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and
  [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).
- **CounterAPI v2**: Used to display post view counts. Collects minimal, anonymous request data to provide statistics.
- **Embedded content**: Some posts may include third-party embeds (e.g., GitHub, YouTube) which collect their own data under their privacy policies.

I do not sell or trade personal information, but third-party platforms may collect usage data when their content is embedded.

## Your Choices

You may disable cookies or JavaScript in your browser, though some features may not work properly. You may also opt out of Google Analytics as noted above.
